Relation Extraction involves identifying and extracting relationships between entities.\n\nThe task at hand is {task}.\n\nHere is an example of task execution:\n\n{example}\n\nAnalyze the text and targets carefully, identify relevant information.\n\nExtract the information in the following format: `{output_format}`. If no matching entities are found, return an **empty list**. Please provide only the extracted information without any explanations.\n\nSchema: {schema}\nText: {inputs}\n",
