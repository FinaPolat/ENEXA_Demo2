Business was successful and the Dasslers were selling 200,000 pairs of shoes every year beforeWorld War II. Both Dassler brothers joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in May 1933 and became members of theNational Socialist Motor Corps.Adolf took the rank ofSportwartin theHitler Youthfrom 1935 until the end of the war.During the war, the company was running the last sport shoe factory in Germany and predominantly supplied theWehrmachtwith shoes. In 1943, their shoe production was forced to cease operations and the company's facilities and workforce was used to manufactureanti-tank weapons. From 1942 to 1945, at least nineforced labourerswere working at both sites of the company. The Dassler factory, used for production ofanti-tank weaponsduring World War II, was nearly destroyed in 1945 by US forces. It was spared when Adolf Dassler's wife convinced the American soldiers that the company and its employees were only interested in manufacturing sports shoes. American occupying forces subsequently became major buyers of the Dassler brothers' shoes.\n", "triples": [{"subject": "Adolf Dassler", "predicate": "founded", "object": "Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik", "subject candidates": "[\n    \"Q108313655 - Adolf Daßler: Bavarian government official\",\n    \"Q76751 - Adolf Dassler: German entrepreneur, founder of Adidas shoe company (1900–1978)\",\n    \"Q15781492 - Statue of Adolf Dassler: Bronze sculpture in Germany\"\n]", "predicate candidates": "[\n    \"P571 - inception: time when an entity begins to exist; for date of official opening use P1619\",\n    \"P800 - notable work: notable scientific, artistic or literary work, or other work of significance among subject's works\",\n    \"P112 - founded by: founder or co-founder of this organization, religion, place or entity\",\n    \"P740 - location of formation: location where a group or organization was formed\"\n]", "object candidates": "[\n    \"Q61237 - Rudolf Dassler: German businessman (1898–1974)\",\n    \"Q12062941 - Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory: German sport shoes company founded by brothers Adolf and Rudolf Dassler, forerunner to Adidas and Puma\"\n]"}, {"subject": "Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik", "predicate": "located_in", "object": "Herzogenaurach, Germany", "subject candidates": "[\n    \"Q61237 - Rudolf Dassler: German businessman (1898–1974)\",\n    \"Q12062941 - Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory: German sport shoes company founded by brothers Adolf and Rudolf Dassler, forerunner to Adidas and Puma\"\n]", "predicate candidates": "[\n    \"P276 - location: location of the object, structure or event; use P131 to indicate the containing administrative entity, P8138 for statistical entities, or P706 for geographic entities; use P7153 for locations associated with the object\",\n    \"P131 - located in the administrative territorial entity: the item is located on the territory of the following administrative entity.

Tapie decided to move productionoffshoreto Asia. He also hiredMadonnafor promotion.He sent, fromChristchurch, New Zealand, a shoe sales representative to Germany and met Adolf Dassler's descendants (Amelia Randall Dassler and Bella Beck Dassler) and was sent back with a few items to promote the company there. In 1992, unable to pay the loan interest, Tapie mandated theCrédit Lyonnaisbank to sell Adidas,and the bank subsequently converted the outstanding debt owed intoequityof the enterprise, which was unusual as per the prevalent French banking practice. Thestate-ownedbank had tried to get Tapie out of dire financial straits as a personal favour to Tapie, it is reported, because Tapie wasMinisterof Urban Affairs (ministre de la Ville) in the French government at the time. Robert Louis-Dreyfus, a friend of Tapie, became the new CEO of the company in 1994. He was also the president ofOlympique de Marseille, a team Tapie had owned until 1993.Tapie filed for personal bankruptcy in 1994.He was the object of several lawsuits, notably related tomatch fixingat the football club. During 1997, he served 6 months of an 18-month prison sentence inLa Santéprison in Paris. In February 2000, Crédit Lyonnais sold Adidas to Louis-Dreyfus for a much higher amount of money than Tapie owed, 4.485 billion (€683.514 million) francs rather than 2.85 billion (€434.479 million).\n", "triples": [{"subject": "Adidas", "predicate": "acquired", "object": "Bernard Tapie", "subject candidates": "[\n    \"Q3895 - Adidas AG: German multinational corporation\",\n    \"Q12358242 - Adidas: trade mark of Adidas AG\",\n    \"Q2824396 - Adidas Power Soccer: 1996 video game\",\n    \"Q4682709 - Adidas Championship Football: 1990 video game\",\n    \"Q113884442 - Adidas Power Soccer International '97: 1997 video game\"\n]", "predicate candidates": "[\n    \"P7888 - merged into: the subject was dissolved and merged into the object, that existed previously\",\n    \"P11812 - afterward owned by: person or institution that owned the subject after stated event.

Adidas remains a major company in the global supply of team kits for international association football teams and clubs. Adidas makesrefereekits that are used in international competition and by many countries and leagues in the world. The company has been an innovator in the area of footwear for the sport, with notable examples including the 1979 release of theCopa Mundialmoulded boot used for matches on firm dry pitches. It holds the accolade of the best selling boot of all time. The soft-ground equivalent was named World Cup and it too remains on the market. Since 1970,FIFA, the world governing body of football, has commissionedspecially designedfootballsfor use in its ownWorld Cuptournaments. TheAdidas Telstarwas the first ball commissioned for the World Cup in 1970. The balls supplied for the2006 World Cup, the \"Teamgeist\", were particularly noteworthy for their ability to travel further than previous types when struck, leading to longer range goals. Goalkeepers were generally believed to be less comfortable with the design of the ball, claiming it was prone to move significantly and unpredictably in flight. Adidas introduced theJabulanifor the2010 World Cup. The ball was designed and developed byLoughborough Universityin conjunction withBayern München. TheAdidas Brazucafor the2014 World Cupwas the first World Cup ball named by the fans.In 2022, for the 14th time in a row, Adidas created the2022 World Cupball,Al Rihla. Adidas is one of the official sponsors of theUEFA Champions League, and theAdidas Finaleis the competition's official match ball.Along with the aforementionedAdidas Predatorboot, Adidas manufactures theadiPurerange of football boots. Adidas named an official match ball of theUEFA Euro 2016tournament theAdidas Beau Jeuwhich translates to \"The Beautiful Game\" in English.Adidas provides clothing and equipment for all teams inMajor League Soccer. Adidas has also provided baseball equipment and sponsors numerous players ofMajor League BaseballandNippon Professional Baseballin Japan. Adidas Baseball hardgoods are licensed to Dick's Sporting Goods. From 1997 to 2008, Adidas sponsored theNew York Yankees. Adidas's Superstar and Pro Model shoes, affectionately known as \"shelltoes\" for their stylized hard rubber toe box, were fueled by, among others, coaches such asUCLA'sJohn Wooden.Adidas drew about even withConversein basketball by the mid-1970s before both started to fall behind then-upstartNikein the early 1980s.Subsequently, Adidas Superstar became very popular in the 1980ship hop streetwearscene alongside Adidas's stripe-sided polyester suits. From 2006 to 2017, Adidas was the uniform supplier of all the 30 teams in theNational Basketball Association, replacing theReebokbrand after Adidas's acquisition of Reebok.

Launched in 2004,\"Impossible is Nothing\"is one of the company's most memorable campaigns.The campaign was developed by 180/TBWA based in Amsterdam, but significant work was also done byTBWAChiatDayin San Francisco.A few years later, Adidas launched a basketball specific campaign -- \"Believe in 5ive\"—for the 2006-2007 NBA season. In 2011,\"Adidas is all in\"became the global marketing strategy slogan for Adidas. The slogan aimed to tie all brands and labels together, presenting a unified image to consumers interested in sports, fashion, street, music and pop culture. There appears to be connection with the phrase \"all-in\" meaning \"exhausted\" in some English speaking nations. In 2015, Adidas launched \"Creating the New\" as its strategic business plan until 2020.\n", "triples": [{"subject": "Adidas", "predicate": "divided_the_brand_into", "object": "three_main_groups", "subject candidates": "[\n    \"Q3895 - Adidas AG: German multinational corporation\",\n    \"Q12358242 - Adidas: trade mark of Adidas AG\",\n    \"Q2824396 - Adidas Power Soccer: 1996 video game\",\n    \"Q4682709 - Adidas Championship Football: 1990 video game\",\n    \"Q113884442 - Adidas Power Soccer International '97: 1997 video game\"\n]", "predicate candidates": "[]", "object candidates": "[]"}, {"subject": "Adidas Performance", "predicate": "designed_to_maintain", "object": "devotion_to_the_athlete", "subject candidates": "[]", "predicate candidates": "[]", "object candidates": "[]"}, {"subject": "Adidas Originals", "predicate": "designed_to_focus_on", "object": "earlier_designs", "subject candidates": "[\n    \"Q4682711 - Adidas Originals: line of casual sports clothing from Adidas\"\n]", "predicate candidates": "[]", "object candidates": "[]"}, {"subject": "Adidas Originals", "predicate": "remained_a_popular_life-style_icon", "object": "true", "subject candidates": "[\n    \"Q4682711 - Adidas Originals: line of casual sports clothing from Adidas\"\n]", "predicate candidates": "[]", "object candidates": "[\n    \"Q16927530 - True: family name\",\n    \"Q61558530 - True: unisex given name\",\n    \"Q93835749 - True: vocal track by Paul Anka; 2004 studio recording; cover version\",\n    \"Q93852356 - True: vocal track by Spandau Ballet; 1983 studio recording\",\n    \"Q25312 - Diptera: order of insects\"\n]"}, {"subject": "Style Essentials", "predicate": "dealt_with", "object": "fashion_market", "subject candidates": "[]", "predicate candidates": "[]", "object candidates": "[\n    \"Q113483679 - Fashion marketing: influencing consumer choice and loyalty with fashion products: book published in 2017\",\n    \"Q57551165 - Fashion Marketing: scholarly article published 7 February 2007\",\n    \"Q120679043 - Fashion Market Niches for Organic Agroforestry Cotton: Market Potential for Promoting Sustainable Supply Chains: scientific article published in 2022\",\n    \"Q129047678 - Fashion Marketing and the Role of Fashion Store Atmosphere in Effective Sales Growth: scholarly article\",\n    \"Q126098110 - Fashion marketing to women in Kazakhstan: scientific article published in 2007\"\n]"}, {"subject": "Y-3", "predicate": "is_a_collaboration_between", "object": "Adidas_and_Yohji_Yamamoto", "subject candidates": "[\n    \"Q54995192 - Y3-Ag 1.2.3: cell line\",\n    \"Q54995127 - Y-3: cell line\",\n    \"Q27256201 - y-39983: chemical compound\",\n    \"Q707890 - Yohji Yamamoto: Japanese fashion designer\",\n    \"Q18395731 - Y-320: chemical compound\"\n]", "predicate candidates": "[]", "object candidates": "[]"}, {"subject": "Y-3", "predicate": "represents", "object": "Yohji_Yamamoto_and_three_stripes_of_Adidas", "subject candidates": "[\n    \"Q54995192 - Y3-Ag 1.2.3: cell line\",\n    \"Q54995127 - Y-3: cell line\",\n    \"Q27256201 - y-39983: chemical compound\",\n    \"Q707890 - Yohji Yamamoto: Japanese fashion designer\",\n    \"Q18395731 - Y-320: chemical compound\"\n]", "predicate candidates": "[\n    \"P180 - depicts: entity visually depicted in an image, literarily described in a work, or otherwise incorporated into an audiovisual or other medium; see also P921, 'main subject'\",\n    \"P1268 - represents: organization, individual, or concept that an entity represents\",\n    \"P1629 - Wikidata item of this property: item corresponding to the concept represented by the property\",\n    \"P9758 - symbol represents: qualifier for \\\"in defining formula\\\" (P7235) which indicates the quantity or operator represented by a symbol in the \\\"defining formula\\\" (P2534)\"\n]", "object candidates": "[]"}, {"subject": "Impossible_is_Nothing", "predicate": "was_launched_in", "object": "2004", "subject candidates": "[\n    \"Q18161378 - Impossible is Nothing: 2012 single by Tonic Breed\",\n    \"Q18161372 - Impossible Is Nothing: single\",\n    \"Q6007476 - Impossible Is Nothing: inadvertently humorous video by internet phenomenon Aleksey Vayner\",\n    \"Q125812887 - Impossible is Nothing: episode of Splatalot!

Relation Extraction involves identifying and extracting relationships between entities.\n\nThe task at hand is RE: Relation Extraction.\n\nHere is an example of task execution:\n\n{'Schema': [{'designed': {'domain': 'Person', 'range': 'Structure'}}, {'located_in': {'domain': 'Structure', 'range': 'Location'}}, {'part_of': {'domain': 'City', 'range': 'Country'}}, {'friends_with': {'domain': 'Person', 'range': 'Person'}}, {'lives_at': {'domain': 'Person', 'range': 'Location'}}, {'visits': {'domain': 'Person', 'range': 'Location'}}, {'accompanied_by': {'domain': 'Person', 'range': 'Person'}}, {'shares': {'domain': 'Person', 'range': 'Product'}}], 'Text': 'Gustave Eiffel designed the Eiffel Tower, which is located in Paris, France.', 'Relations': [['Gustave Eiffel', 'designed', 'Eiffel Tower'], ['Eiffel Tower', 'located_in', 'Paris'], ['Paris', 'part_of', 'France']]}\n\nAnalyze the text and targets carefully, identify relevant information.\n\nExtract the information in the following format: `[[\"Subject\", \"Relation\", \"Object\"], ...]`. If no matching entities are found, return an **empty list**. Please provide only the extracted information without any explanations.\n\nSchema: [{\"part_of\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Organization\"}}, {\"parent_company_of\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Organization\"}}, {\"subsidiary_of\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Organization\"}}, {\"acquired\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Organization\"}}, {\"divested\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Organization\"}}, {\"owns_brand\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Product/Brand\"}}, {\"holds_stake_in\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Organization\"}}, {\"spun_off\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Organization\"}}, {\"formed_from\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Organization\"}}, {\"founded_by\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Person\"}}, {\"has_CEO\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Person\"}}, {\"manufactures\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"ProductType\"}}, {\"develops\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"ProductType\"}}, {\"produces\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"ProductType\"}}, {\"sells\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"ProductType\"}}, {\"has_product_line\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Product/Brand\"}}, {\"is_a_type_of\": {\"domain\": \"Product/Brand\", \"range\": \"ProductType\"}}, {\"is_brand_of\": {\"domain\": \"Product/Brand\", \"range\": \"Organization\"}}, {\"features_technology\": {\"domain\": \"Product/Brand\", \"range\": \"Technology\"}}, {\"uses_material\": {\"domain\": \"Product/Brand\", \"range\": \"Material\"}}, {\"launched_product\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Product/Brand\"}}, {\"had_revenue_of\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Amount\"}}, {\"had_profit_of\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Amount\"}}, {\"in_year\": {\"domain\": \"FinancialMetric\", \"range\": \"Year\"}}, {\"market_value_of\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Amount\"}}, {\"is_publicly_traded\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Boolean\"}}, {\"listed_on_exchange\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"StockExchange\"}}, {\"experienced_growth\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"FinancialMetric\"}}, {\"occurred_in_year\": {\"domain\": \"Event/Action\", \"range\": \"Year\"}}, {\"occurred_on_date\": {\"domain\": \"Event/Action\", \"range\": \"SpecificDate\"}}, {\"resulted_in\": {\"domain\": \"Event/Action\", \"range\": \"Outcome\"}}, {\"preceded\": {\"domain\": \"Event/Action\", \"range\": \"Event/Action\"}}, {\"followed_by\": {\"domain\": \"Event/Action\", \"range\": \"Event/Action\"}}, {\"marked_milestone\": {\"domain\": \"Event/Action\", \"range\": \"Organization\"}}, {\"influenced_by\": {\"domain\": \"Event/Action\", \"range\": \"Event/Action\"}}, {\"led_to\": {\"domain\": \"Event/Action\", \"range\": \"Event/Action\"}}, {\"was_a_response_to\": {\"domain\": \"Event/Action\", \"range\": \"Event/Action\"}}, {\"has_trademark\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Trademark\"}}, {\"uses_logo\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Logo\"}}, {\"acquired_trademark_from\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Organization\"}}, {\"is_known_for\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"Characteristic\"}}, {\"launched_campaign\": {\"domain\": \"Organization\", \"range\": \"BusinessConcept\"}}]\nText: article: Adidas, SL 72 sneaker advertising campaign: In July 2024, Adidas withdrew and apologized for their advertising campaign starringBella Hadidfor theSL 72which was originally created for the1972 Munich Olympicswhere themassacreof 11 Israeli athletes took place.\n", "triples": [{"subject": "Adidas", "predicate": "launched_campaign", "object": "SL 72 sneaker advertising campaign", "subject candidates": "[\n    \"Q3895 -
