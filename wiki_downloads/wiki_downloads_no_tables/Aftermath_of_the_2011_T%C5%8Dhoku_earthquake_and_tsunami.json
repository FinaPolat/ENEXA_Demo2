Thetsunamicreated over 300,000 refugees in theTōhoku regionofJapan, and resulted in shortages of food, water, shelter, medicine and fuel for survivors. 15,900 deaths have been confirmed. In response to the crisis, the Japanese government mobilized theSelf-Defence Forces, while many countries sent search and rescue teams to help search for survivors. Aid organizations both in Japan and worldwide also responded, with theJapanese Red Crossreporting $1 billion in donations. The economic impact included both immediate problems, with industrial production suspended in many factories, and the longer-term issue of the cost of rebuilding which has been estimated at ¥10 trillion (US$122 billion).",
            "A further serious impact of the tsunami was the critical damage done to theFukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, resulting insevere releases of radioactivityand the prospect of a long-term health andenvironmental hazardin need of an expensive clean-up."

This was the first time a nuclear emergency had been declared in Japan, and 140,000 residents within 20 km (12 mi) of the plant were evacuated.Explosions and a fire have resulted in dangerous levels ofradiation, sparking a stock market collapse and panic-buying in supermarkets.The UK, France and some other countries advised their nationals to consider leaving Tokyo, in response to fears of spreading nuclear contamination. The accidents have drawn attention to ongoing concerns overJapanese nuclear seismic design standardsand caused other governments tore-evaluate their nuclear programs. As of April 2011, water is still being poured into the damaged reactors to cool melting fuel rods. John Price, a former member of the Safety Policy Unit at the UK's National Nuclear Corporation, has said that it \"might be 100 years before melting fuel rods can be safely removed from Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant\".",

As of June 2011, \"more than 80 percent of Japanese now say they areanti-nuclearand distrust government information onradiation\".The ongoing Fukushima crisis may spell the end of nuclear power in Japan, as \"citizen opposition grows and local authorities refuse permission to restart reactors that have undergone safety checks\". Local authorities are skeptical that sufficient safety measures have been taken and are reticent to give their permission – now required by law – to bring suspended nuclear reactors back online."
