            "The2005 Birmingham tornadowas an IF3tornadowhich became the costliest tornado ever recorded inGreat Britain. The tornado occurred on 28 July 2005 in the Southern and Eastern suburbs ofBirmingham. It formed on a day when thunderstorms were expected to develop across the Midlands and eastern England. The tornado touched down at approximately 14:37BSTin the King’s Heath area and moved north-northeasterly, affectingKing's Heath,Moseley,Sparkhill,Balsall Heath,SaltleyandErdingtonas it carved a roughly 7 mi (11 km) long path through the city.Several organizations have rated this tornadowith various degrees of intensity; most recently theEuropean Severe Storms Laboratoryrated the tornado IF3 on theInternational Fujita scalein December 2024."

            "Previous tornadoes",
            "While England has more reported tornadoes, relative to its land area, than any other country, the vast majority are weak. According to theMet Office, around 30 tornadoes hit the UK every year, though most are small and dissipate without causing significant damage.",
            "Several tornadoes have struck the city of Birmingham. AnF3 tornadostruck the city in 1931, killing one woman and severely damaging hundreds of houses.On 23 November 1981, during a record-breakingnationwide tornado outbreak, three tornadoes touched down within the Birmingham city limits – inErdington, King’s Heath, andSelly Oak– with three other tornadoes touching down within the boundaries of the widerWest Midlandscounty.Notable tornadoes also struck the city in 1946, 1968, and 1999.",
            "Meteorological synopsis",
            "On the morning of July 28, a shallow depression was located southwest ofCornwall, with a slow-movingwarm frontextending across the Midlands and acold frontadvancing from the southwest. Early cloud cover gave way to breaks in the afternoon, allowing surface heating to destabilize the atmosphere. This heating, combined with anelevated mixed layerof dry air advected from Spain, created conditions favorable for intense convection.",
            "Key to the tornado formation was the development of a triple point, where the synoptic cold front intersected an insolation-enhanced warm front, a boundary strengthened by solar heating. This intersection enhanced low-level convergence and vorticity, providing the necessary lift for thunderstorm development. The environment featured moderate instability (1000–1600 J/kg ofCAPE) and extreme wind shear, particularly in the lowest 1–3 km of the atmosphere, where directional shear promoted rotating updrafts.",
            "Initial storm development began by 13:45 GMT, and the storms exhibitedsupercellularcharacteristics, with one nearPeterboroughsplitting into distinct left and right-moving cells. The Birmingham cell subsequently developed at around 13:45 GMT."

            "At 2:29 PM BST, a funnel cloud was photographed from the Hopwood Park Service area on the M42 motorway, 8.5 miles south of Birmingham. TORRO concluded this to be a separate, T2 tornado. By around 2:37PM, the main tornado began in Howard Road, Kings Heath. Initially crossing the High Street, the tornado inflicted roof damage to several buildings, including a roof torn off and thrown across the road. A woman was taken to hospital after being struck by flying debris.",
            "Continuing northeastward into Wake Green and Moseley, the tornado began causing more significant damage to trees and homes. Several streets including Blenheim Rd were completely blocked by fallen trees.",
            "Reaching Balsall Heath, the tornado attained peak IF3 intensity: several shops had their windows blown out and lost portions of their roofs. Several rows of terraced homes along Birchwood Road and Alder Road in Balsall Heath had their roofs torn off, and several sustained exterior wall damage to the upper floors. Cars were rolled several metres down driveways, and trees were flattened in Balsall Heath park.",
            "Continuing northwards across Stratford Road,Ladypool Primary Schoolwas extensively damaged and lost its distinctiveMartin & Chamberlaintower. The adjacentSt Agatha's Churchalso suffered some damage.Christ Church(consecrated in 1867), on the corner of Dolobran Road and Grantham Road in Sparkbrook, was also damaged and has now been demolished.",
            "Farm Park, Sparkhill suffered severe damage, shortly before the approached Coventry Road where it significantly damaged a Wedding Hall and several homes.",
            "At this point, the tornado was weakening as it continued northwards pastSt Andrew’s Stadium. A brick wall was blown down at Saltley Viaduct, and minor tree damage was noted along Heartlands Parkway at the intersection with Cuckoo Road.",
            "The tornado crossed theM6 Motorwayjust east of the Gravelly Hill interchange. TV Aerial damage is found in The Oval, Erdington, as well as minor roof damage. The final instance of damage came from Erdington Abbey, where trees suffered minor branch damage."

            "Immediately following the tornado, more than 50 ambulance, and 10 fire crews were deployed to the scene, along with sniffer dogs, and West Midlands Fire Service declared a major incident. Over a dozen people were taken to hospital for treatment, 39 were injured, several severely.Then-Birmingham council leader, Paul Tillesley, remarked that it was a “miracle” that no fatalities occurred.",
            "Hundreds of residents were evacuated from significantly damaged areas, particularly Balsall Heath, while emergency services searched over 1000 properties. Overall, more than 500 buildings were damaged, including 115 businesses, Ladypool Primary School, churches, and hundreds of houses- several were subsequently marked for demolition.",
            "Birmingham City Council provided emergency accommodation for over 160 people following the tornado, and granted a £1 million recovery fund.  The tornado is the costliest on record in the UK, having caused £40 million of damage, equivalent to £75 million in 2023."

            "In August 2006,Timothy P. Marshalland Stuart Robinson with the Haag Engineering Co, rated the tornado EF2 on a draft version of the-then unpublishedEnhanced Fujita scale, marking one of the first tornadoes to receive an EF-scale rating.In July 2015, the tornado was rated T5–6 on theTORRO scaleby theTornado and Storm Research Organisationbased on the United Kingdom.TheEuropean Severe Storms Laboratoryrated the tornado F2, on theFujita scaleand T4 on the TORRO scale. However, in December 2024, this rating was amended to IF3 on the newInternational Fujita scale."
