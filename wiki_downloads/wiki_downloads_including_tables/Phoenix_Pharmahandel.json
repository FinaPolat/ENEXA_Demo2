Schulze GmbH (Mannheim), Otto Stumpf AG (Nuremberg), and Hageda AG (Cologne) in early 1994. The newly established enterprise has achieved a market leading position in its home markets from day one. Only one year later in 1995, the company brand Phoenix was established and a major strategy roll-out throughout Germany,Hungary,Italyand theNetherlandswas initiated: During this process Phoenix acquired majority shareholdings in the Hungarian pharma wholesaling company Parma Rt., the Northern Italian pharmaceutical wholesaler Comifar S.p.A., 60-per cent shareholding in the second-largest Dutch pharmaceutical wholesaler ACF Holding NV, based inMaarssennearUtrecht.",
            "In 1996, the Phoenix Group already achieved a group-wide turnover exceeding EUR 10 billion for the first time in its history. Following this achievement, further acquisitions in Italy, the Czech Republic and Hungary were completed to strengthen the market position. In addition, new branches were established inPolandandFrance. Several problems in Poland and Hungary triggered a country-exclusive restructuring process in 1997 and was accompanied by a 100% takeover of theAustriancompany Hestag and the renaming of Schulze Pharma France in Phoenix Pharma during the same year.",
            "The entry into the United Kingdom market occurred in 1998 with the establishment of 11 distribution centres, a wholesale network with almost nationwide coverage. In the same year, Phoenix Group also acquired the regional wholesalers L. Rowland & Co. and Philip Harris Medical to establish a Phoenix presence in the UK, with the aim of establishing a third significant player in the pharmaceutical distribution industry, alongsideAAH/LloydsandUnichem/Moss. The Rowlands estate comprised approximately 70 pharmacies in November 2011.",
            "In 2000, the number of employees across the group exceeded 10,000 for the first time and the company acquired the Finnish Tamro Group in April with a 33.7% stake. In the year 2002, Phoenix Pharmahandel AG & Co KG merged with Ferd. Schulze GmbH Co., subsequently its number of employees across the group exceeded 15,000 for the first time with a group-wide turnover of more than EUR 15 billion. Two years later, Phoenix received title to all shares of Tamro Corporation in May 2004 and subsequently acquired a 100% shareholding in Tamro: It was the largest acquisition in the history of Phoenix successfully to date; Tamro was delisted from the Helsinki Stock Exchange in the same year. In 2006, the group-wide turnover exceeds EUR 20 billion for the first time.",
